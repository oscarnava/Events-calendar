## To-do's
### Backend
- Admin panel to create, update and remove events.
- **Important!** User email validation. (I'm sick of receiving unwanted emails from unverified services; I don't want others to suffer this because of me).

### Frontend
- Possibility to filter the events list to show only the logged user scheduled events.
- Prevent rating the event before it takes place.
- Display a divider between events for different days, to aid the user on locating the day's event.
