This project consists of an app to publish a calendar of events to follow in my hometown, Morelia.

The events are listed by date, and if the user signs/logs in, the system will keep record of the events added to the user's schedule, and the user will be able to rate the event.

## Built with:
- Ruby / Rails
- Javascript / React / Redux
- Lots of coffee...

## Live demo:
  * [Events calendar](https://oscarnava.github.io/Events-calendar/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ruby: Check [this link](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) if you need to install it.
- Rails: Check [this link](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) if you need to install it.
- Node.js: Check [this link](https://nodejs.org/es/) if you need to install it.
- PostgreSQL: Check [this link](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) if you need to install it.

### Setup
You can start by clonning this repository in your local storage. You will notice there are two folders named _**backend**_ and _**frontend**_. Please refer to the specific README inside each folder for further instructions on setting it up.

### Deployment
Since this is a rather unusual way of organizing a repository, please check this article on [**Deploying Rails API and React App to Heroku from a single GitHub repo**](https://medium.com/@nothingisfunny/deploying-rails-api-and-react-app-to-heroku-from-a-single-github-repo-7d8597abc55a), or if you prefer you can just [**split the subfolders out into a new repository**](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/splitting-a-subfolder-out-into-a-new-repository).

Again, please refer to the specific README inside each folder for further instructions.

### To-do's
#### Backend
- Admin panel to create, update and remove events.
- **Important!** User email validation. (I'm sick of receiving unwanted emails from unverified services; I don't want others to suffer this because of me).

#### Frontend
- Possibility to filter the events list to show only the logged user scheduled events.
- Prevent rating the event before it takes place.
- Display a divider between events for different days, to aid the user on locating the day's event.
